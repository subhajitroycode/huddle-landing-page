## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned a lot about responsive design and how to use flexbox to achieve that. I also learned how to use the SCSS/SASS syntax to style the page. Also learned a lot about background-size, background-position, and background-repeat.


```scss
&:hover {
  color: darken($secondary-color, 15%);
  border-color: darken($secondary-color, 15%);
}
```
